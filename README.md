# Part A: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Issues Results

1. **Missing Data**:
   - `income_groups`: 6,306 missing entries (around 5%).
   - `age`: 6,223 missing entries.
   - `gender`: 5,907 missing entries.
   - `year`: 6,202 missing entries.
   - `population`: 6,340 missing entries.

2. **Data Types**:
   - Most columns (`age`, `gender`, `year`, `population`) are stored as `float64`, which may be unnecessary for categorical data like `gender` and `year`.

3. **Gender Representation**:
   - The `gender` column uses numeric values (e.g., 1.0, 3.0). The value `3.0` seems irregular for a binary gender representation.

4. **Age**:
   - There are records where `age` is 0, which could represent newborns or invalid data.



# Part B: Data Cleaning Process

## Input Data: `messy_population_data.csv`
The dataset contains population data with issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data types, and outliers. This script addresses these issues systematically.

### Cleaning Process:

1. **Missing Values**:
   - **Method**: Rows with more than 50% missing values are dropped. For other missing values in numeric columns, the column mean is used to fill in the gaps.

2. **Duplicate Rows**:
   - **Method**: Identified and removed duplicate rows.

3. **Data Type Correction**:
   - **Method**: Converted the `population` column to a numeric data type.

4. **Outlier Removal**:
   - **Method**: Removed rows with values greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean in numeric columns.

5. **Standardization** (Optional):
   - **Method**: Standardized the `population` column by converting values to z-scores (mean of 0, standard deviation of 1).

### Error Handling and Logging:
- The script includes error handling to log any issues encountered during the cleaning process. A log file (`clean_data.log`) is generated for tracking purposes.
- Errors such as missing input files or issues during the cleaning process will be captured and documented in the log.

## Output Data: `cleaned_population_data.csv`

The cleaned dataset has improved data quality, with missing values addressed, duplicates removed, correct data types, and outliers handled. 



# Part C: More Summary

The cleaned dataset, `cleaned_population_data.csv`, has been refined to enhance its quality for data analysis. Key features include:

- **Missing Values**:
  - Rows with missing values in various columns, such as `age`, have been removed, leading to improved data reliability.
  - For the remaining numerical columns, missing values were replaced with the mean of each respective column, ensuring minimal disruption to the data distribution.

- **Duplicates**:
  - All duplicate entries were eliminated, resulting in a unique set of records that better reflects the population data without redundancy.

- **Data Types**:
  - Data types were corrected, ensuring that numerical columns, particularly `population`, are now in a numeric format rather than float. This change facilitates more straightforward calculations and analyses.

- **Outliers**:
  - Rows containing outliers were removed, enhancing the accuracy of the dataset.

# Comparison with the Original Dirty Dataset

The original dirty dataset (`messy_population_data.csv`) exhibited several issues, including:

- **High Missing Values**: Several columns had a significant percentage of missing values, which could skew analyses.
- **Duplicates**: The presence of duplicate records inflated the dataset size without providing additional valuable information.
- **Incorrect Data Types**: Some categorical data were incorrectly stored as numerical types, potentially leading to erroneous analyses.
- **Outliers**: Extreme values were present that could misrepresent the population metrics.

The cleaned dataset reduces noise from duplicates and outliers, resulting in higher reliability due to the addressed missing values.

# Challenges Faced and Overcoming Them

### Challenge 1: Handling Missing Values
- **Solution**: I opted to drop rows with more than 50% missing data to maintain quality while filling in the remaining missing values with column means. This approach minimized the loss of valuable information.

### Challenge 2: Identifying Outliers
- **Solution**: Detecting outliers required a solid understanding of the data distribution. I implemented a statistical method (three standard deviations) for identifying outliers, ensuring that the method was both systematic and justifiable.

### Challenge 3: Data Type Corrections
- **Solution**: Initially, it was unclear which columns needed type conversions. I utilized the `info()` method in Pandas to review data types and implemented targeted conversions based on data context.

# Reflections on the Learning Process

This data cleaning process reinforced the importance of:

- **Data Quality**: Clean data is crucial for reliable analysis. This experience underscored that even minor data issues can lead to significant biases in results.
- **Statistical Understanding**: Gaining insights into statistical concepts, like standard deviation and its application in outlier detection, was enlightening and applicable to future data analyses.
- **Documentation**: Keeping detailed logs of actions taken during the cleaning process helped maintain clarity about the changes made, which is vital for future reference or replication of results.

# Potential Next Steps or Further Improvements

In the future, I plan to implement automated checks for data integrity to ensure ongoing data quality in analyses and maintain proper logs of all data quality enhancements.
